\SKN[\TRM[Revinage®\]
\DES[A safe, stable, plant-based alternative to \SUB[retinoids\] for the treatment 
of \BEN[aging\] skin. \TRM[Revinage®\] is an exclusive supercritical apolar extract 
of \CMN[Picão Preto\] (\SCN[Bidens pilosa\]) standardized in \SUB[phytol\]\].

\RTB[\SUB[Retinoids\]
• Family of compounds related to \SUB[vitamin A\] and its derivatives
• It binds to specific \MLT[nuclear receptors – RAR (retinoic acid receptors)\] and \MLT[RXR (retinoid X receptors)\]\]

• \BEN[Highly efﬁ cient for the treatment of aging, 
   photoaging, acne, psoriasis and others\]
• \ADP[The most prescribed active ingredient\]

• \CAU[Diverse side effects include skin irritation, 
   photosensibility, telangiectasia, teratogenicity 
   and embriotoxicity
• Instability in contact with light and oxygen\]

How It Works
\CLA|MOA[\TRM[Revinage®\] provides \SUB[retinol\]-like behavior by binding to the \MLT[RXR receptor\] and reducing by \NUM[20\]\UNT[%\] the \MLT[RAR\] 
expression while increasing the \MLT[RXR\] expression by \NUM[119\]\UNT[%\] resulting in effective \BEN[anti-aging\] and 
\BEN[anti-photoaging\] action\]:

1. \RTB[Stimulates the cellular proliferation, differentiation and extracellular matrix production\]
\MOA[\TRM[Revinage®\] upregulates gene expression of \MLT[EGFr\] and \SUB[pro-collagen\], increasing the production of \SUB[collagen\] type I and 
IV, \SUB[elastin\] and the \MLT[growth factors\] \MLT[FGF-β\] and \MLT[TGF-β\], in addition to inhibit the production of \MLT[MMP-1\]\].
2. \RTB[Features antioxidant activity and the regulation of cell senescence\]
\MOA[\TRM[Revinage®\] stimulates the production of \MLT[SOD\] and \MLT[CAT\] in addition to reduce the production of free radicals and 
lipoperoxidation and stimulate gene expression of \MLT[SIRT6\].
3. \CLA[Provides soothing effect\]
\MOA[\TRM[Revinage®\] regulates the activity of \MLT[AP-1\], \MLT[COX-2\], \MLT[PGE2\] and \MLT[LTB4\] featuring excellent \BEN[soothing\] effect\].
4. \CLA[Stimulates \BEN[skin lightening\]\]
\MOA[\TRM[Revinage®\] reduces the production of \SUB[alpha-MSH\] and, as a result the production of \SUB[melanin\]\].

5. \CLA[Controls \BEN[skin oiliness\]\]
\MOA[\TRM[Revinage®\] reduces the production of \SUB[DHT\], an important mediator in the production of \SUB[sebum\] in the skin\].
