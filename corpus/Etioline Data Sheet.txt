\SKN[\TRM[Etioline TM\]

SKIN LIGHTENING - HOMOGENEITY OF SKIN TONE

Function and Characteristics:

\DES[ETIOLINE is a concentrated, purified and standardised 

extract obtained from a rare African plant:  \CMN[Mitracarpe\], of 

Spermacoceae genus.

In Benin, the most original property attributed to 

Mitracarpe leaves lays in the \BEN[treatment of dark spots and 

in skin fading\].

In order to obtain a marked \ADP[synergic effect\], we 

associated \CMN[Mitracarpe\] with \CMN[Bearberry\] (\SCN[Arctostaphylos 

uva ursi\]) extract.

Cosmetic interest (properties):

ETIOLINE is an active ingredient designed for the 

treatment of pigmentary spots and cutaneous  

discolouration problems. Its activity based on \ROS[\REG[African\] 

ethnobotanical experience\] is confirmed by a \MOA[strong 

\MLT[tyrosinase\] inhibitory activity\] \VIT[in vitro and ex vivo\]\].

Applications:

\FOR[Whitening lotions and creams\].

\VIT[EX VIVOIN VITRO

Inhibitory effect of ETIOLINE on tyrosinase activity:

\MSR[The \MLT[tyrosinase\] inhibition is dose-dependent.

\USL[\NUM[1\]\UNT[%\]\] \TRM[ETIOLINE\] totally inhibits enzyme activity. When \SUB[L-DOPA\] is applied onto the histological slides 

together with ETIOLINE, \SUB[melanin\]  synthesis is 

inhibited (B): no dark colouration is observed.

For the first time, \SUB[melanin\] synthesis inhibition can 

be directly observed on the skin\].

Inhibition of melanin synthesis:

Skin biopsies histologically coloured with  L-DOPA in the 

presence (B) and in the absence (A) of 5% ETIOLINE.
