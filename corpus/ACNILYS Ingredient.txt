"\DES|ACN[Problem skins gather oily , acne - prone and imperfection - prone skins ."
"In the 12 - 24 age group , up to 85 % of the population is affected ."
"In addition of this teenager issue , adult skin also suffers more and more from these imperfections caused by hormones , but also by \STE[pollution , stress or nutrition\] : \RTB[excess and oxidation of sebum\] , \RTB[multiplication of Propionibacterium ( cutibacterium ) acnes\] , \RTB[hyperkeratinization and inflammation\] give to the skin a \BEN[shiny appearance , a thick grain , a complexion blurred by redness and marks\] ..."
"The face loses clearness , freshness and the psychological feeling can be impacted in accentuated cases ."
"Moreover these components are linked and acne phenomenon behaves like a vicious circle , each component increasing the other one ."
It is therefore a chronic and multifactorial pathophysiology requiring a complete action on all identified targets to achieve the balance of healthy and clear skin\] .
ACTIONS  
\CLA[Prevents hyperseborrhea  
Limits P . acnes proliferation  
Reduces inflammation

"EFFICACY ORIGIN 
\RTB|COP[Based on a bibliographic selection of plant extracts , a biological screening on specific targets allowed GREENTECH Research to identify the berries of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa ."
"This plant presents potent \PRO[anti - inflammatory , antioxidant and anti - microbial\] properties due to its content in :"
 Acylphloroglucinols ( rhodomyrtone and derivatives )  
 Polyphenols ( piceatannol and derivatives )  
 Organic acids

Rhodomyrtone\]

"COSMETIC BENEFITS 
\BEN[The skin is less oily and shiny , the pores are refined and tightened ; better moisturized the skin regains radiance and freshness ."
"Skin imperfections , pimples and redness ease , the complexion becomes smooth again\]
 ."
