INCI Name: 

     \INC[Ascorbyl Glucoside\] 

\CAS[CAS Number:  

129499-78-1\]  

\DES[Description:  

Among  the  well  studied,  2-derivatives  of  stabilized  \SUB[L-Ascorbic  Acid\],  the  \SUB[2-glucoside 
(Ascorbyl    Glucoside)\]  is  preferred  by  most  researchers  for  post-UV  efficacy  in           
\BEN[antioxidant  activity\],  in  \RTB[Inflammation  mitigation\],  in  \RTB[\SUB[collagen\]  stimulation\]  and  finally  for   
\MOA[inhibition of melanogenesis\]. \ROS[\TRN[G-Hexuron\] is the stabilized form of \SUB[Vitamin C\]\] that can be 
topically  applied  to  the  skin  in  advanced  formulations  specifically  targeted  for          
\BEN[antiaging\]  and  \BEN[photo-protection\]  benefits.  \STB[G-Hexuron  is  the  water  soluble,  Vitamin  C,     
2-derivative  with  superior  formulation  stability.    G-Hexuron  is  both  bioavailable  and    
bioactive  in  its  2-glucoside  form  and  has  been  shown  to  be  more  bio-persistent  over 
time vs. Vitamin C\]. G-Hexuron is photo-protective, \BEN[visibly lightens skin\]  and possesses 
\BEN[anti-aging\] properties similar to \SUB[Vitamin C\]\].

\VIV[]In-vivo testing of \TRN[G-Hexuron\] to show \BEN[skin lightening\] effect 

\PRT[In clinical testing, \NUM[sixteen\] female volunteers, ages (\RAN[37 to 55\]) were 
used to test the \BEN[skin lightening\] effects.             

\USL[\NUM[2\]\UNT[%\] \TRN[G-Hexuron\] was applied \USF[twice a day\] for a period of \DUR[90 days\] to 
show an increase in \BEN[skin lightening\]\].  

\MSR[As  a  result,  \BEN[skin  lightening\]  increased  by  \NUM[80\]\UNT[%\]  in  \DUR[45  days\],  and 
\NUM[120\]\UNT[%\] in \DUR[90 days\].  Which is a ratio of 1.5 on day 45, and 2.5 after 
90 days\].                                     

 

In-vivo testing of G-Hexuron to show \BEN[anti-wrinkle\] effect 

\PRT[Clinical  testing  in  an  \BEN[anti-aging\] skin study  was  conducted  on six-
teen female volunteers, age \RAN[37 to 55\]. 

\USL[\NUM[2\]\UNT[%\]  \TRN[G-Hexuron\]  in  a  formulation  was  applied  \USF[twice  a  day\]  over  \DUR[90 
days\]. The formulation  was applied to the \BOP[lateral area (crow’s feet 
area) of the  volunteers eyes and thoroughly  across the cheek ar-
ea\]\].  

\MSR[As a result, the \BEN[appearance of wrinkle depth\] is well improved after 
\DUR[45 days\] and substantially improved at \DUR[90 days\]\]\]. 

\VIT[In-vitro testing of G-Hexuron to show \MOA[\SUB[melanin reduction\](1) 

\PRT[An in-vitro culture  was  treated  with \USL[\NUM[2\]  \UNT[mmol/L\] of  \TRN[G-Hexuron\], \SUB[AA-
2P\],  or  \SUB[Vitamin C\]  (Vit.  C).  \SUB[Melanin\] content  was  checked  after  \TPO[24\] \UNT[hrs\] 
and \TPO[48\] \UNT[hours\]\]. 

\MSR[After  \TPO[one  day\],  \TRN[G-Hexuron\]  significantly  reduced  \SUB[melanin\]  content 
compared to  untreated  cells. After \TPO[two  days\],  \TRN[G-Hexuron\] significantly  reduced  \SUB[melanin\]  content  compared  to  all  other 
groups\]. 

\PRT[In-vitro testing of G-Hexuron to show it promotes \RTB[\SUB[collagen\] protein synthesis\](2) 

An in-vitro culture of human \BBC[fibroblasts\] was grown in the presence 
of TRN[G-Hexuron\] for \RAN[1-8 days\]. 

\MSR[\TRN[G-Hexuron\]  promoted  a  significant  increase  in  \SUB[collagen\]  synthesis 
compared to the untreated group. 

Notably,  \SUB[collagen\]  synthesis  decreased  in  \SUB[Vitamin  C\]  and  \SUB[AA-2P\] 
treated  cells  at  \TPO[day  5\],  while  levels  for  \TRN[G-Hexuron\]  treated  cells 
remained stable\]\].
