History / Uses 

\STO[King of the forest, symbol of wisdom, power and immortality, the oak tree is solid and resists the test of 
time. Sacred tree in numerous traditions, Celts saw in the tree the axis of the world deploying its majesty 
between sky and earth.  

Living up to \DUR[500 years\], oak has to synthesize molecules of defence and protection to adapt to its 
environment. Indeed, the more vegetal species live on, the more their antioxidant capital rises. These 
molecules are phenolic compounds mainly \SUB[tannins\], \SUB[ellagitannins\], \SUB[gallotannins\] and \SUB[condensed tannins\], 
which give to oak tree intense \PRO[astringent\] and \PRO[antioxidant\] properties.  

Oak tree is traditional used as an \PRO[astringent\], \PRO[soothing\], \PRO[tonifying\] and \PRO[fortifying agent\].
