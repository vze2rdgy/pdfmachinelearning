\SKN[\TRN[aceromine\]
\STO[phytobioactives concentrate of stabilized natural \SUB[vitamin c\]
\RTB[\SUB[Vitamin C\] is a very efficient \PRO[anti - oxidant\] .
It stops the radicalar chain reaction by capturing free radicals\] .
"At the level of the skin , it is not only necessary to fight against the production of free radicals ( solar irradiation , aging , etc ) but also combat for the modulation of enzymatic activities ."
"\RTB[In fact , it intervenes in the synthesis of pro - \SUB[collagen\] ( by controlling the replication of genes \MLT[proa1\] , \MLT[proa2\] and \MLT[proa3\] ) but also in its transformation into functional \SUB[collagen\] ( cofactor of the enzymes \MLT[prolyl and lysil - hydroxylase\] )."
\SUB[Vitamin C\] can also act in the first stages in the pigmentation process\] .
"The utilization of a natural vitamin C concentrate can then be recommended for the development of anti aging products , protective and regenerating creams , sun protectants , after sun products , lightening and liquid foundation ."
"\SCN[Malpighia punicifolia\] , the acerola is a cherry originating from \REG[West Indies\] and it is widespread in warm parts of both American continents ."
Its small ( 1 to 2 cm of diameter ) and bright red \BPA[fruits\] grow on little trees .
"It has , by far , the highest content of \SUB[vitamin C\] among all fruits ."
Fruits have been used traditionnally for dysentery treatment .
It is used in \REG[Brazil\] for fruit juice production\] .
\COP[composition
"\MAN[For stabilizing \SUB[vitamin C\] immediately after harvesting , the acerola extract is spray dried with \SUB[maltodextrin\] and encapsulated in a liposome\] ."
aceromine is titrated in : vitamin c : 1 . 4 % - 2 %\]
activities
\RTB[ACEROMINE activity is due to its high content in \SUB[vitamin C\]\] .
