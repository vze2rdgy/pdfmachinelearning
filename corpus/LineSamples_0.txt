\RTB[Moss Tissue Culture to Improve Cell Nucleus Health and Fortify the Skin With MossCellTec  No .1\].
Mibelle Biochemistry offers an anti - aging treatment that is based on a novel concept : \RTB[cell nucleus health\].
\RTB[MossCellTec  No . 1 supports cell nucleus health by improving the expression of protein markers that :  structure the nuclear envelope  enable the efficient transport of molecules into and out of the nucleus\].
\RTB[Together , both allow for a proper communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm , which is essential for the cell functioning\].
\RTB[Therefore , preserving the cell nucleus health represents a novel strategy in the fight against aging\].
\STO[MossCellTec  No .1 has been developed from an extract of the cells of the \BOT[Physcomitrella patens moss\]\].
\STO[It is the first active ingredient on the market that is based on bio technologically produced moss which is obtained in a reproducible and sustainable way by tissue culture\].
\RTB[Therefore , by maintaining an efficient transport of the molecules into and out of the nucleus and by preserving the organization of the nuclear envelope , the commu - nication inside the cell is optimized and cells can adapt more quickly to the ever - changing environment , making our \BEN[skin more resilient\]\].
\STO[Mosses Extraordinarily resilient to environmental changes\].
\STOThe Pioneer Plants that Actively Built the Soil Mosses , which belong to the Bryophyte group , are among the first land plants to have conquered the earth approximately 470 million years ago\] ( 1 ).
\STO[These pioneer organisms can be found virtually all over the world\].
\STO[Mosses contribute to the building and structure of the ground , prevent erosion and provide humus for other plants such as trees to flourish\].
\STO[They also offer a habitat to a variety of small organisms\].
\STO[Furthermore , mosses are able to trap excess water and nutrients from the soil , air and rain by acting like a sponge\].
\STO[Mosses can rapidly absorb \SUB[water\] from the atmo sphere in a consistent way ( up to 20 times their weight)\].
\STO[Meanwhile , in dry weather , mosses gradually restore the rainwater and in doing so increase the humidity and cool down the air\].
\STO[The Plants that Best Resist the Lack of Water Mosses neither have roots nor a vascular system that allow for the transportation and storage of \SUB[water\] and nutrients\].
\STO[These \SUB[compounds\] are absorbed by imbibi - tion and diffusion through the numerous and ultrathin leaves of the moss\].
\STO[Mosses are able to tolerate long periods of desiccation where they stop their metabolism ( dormant phase ) thanks to metabolites that retain \SUB[water\]\].
\STO[When \SUB[water\] is available again , mosses can rehydrate in just a few minutes and return to a normal life ( revivis - cence phenomenon )\].
\STO[Mosses Can Be Found Virtually All Over the World\].
\STO[High Tolerance to Freezing thanks to  Cold Genes  Mosses have leaves that consist of a singular cell layer which means that every single cell is exposed to and must handle the environmental stresses\].
\STO[Unlike higher plants , mosses are able to survive several freeze - thawing cycles\].
\STO[Indeed , despite being frozen under hundreds of meters of ice for over 1 , 500 years they are still alive\] ( 2 ).
\STO[This extraordinary resilience is due to the presence of  cold genes  that are unique to mosses and which turn on as soon as the temperature drops\] ( 3 ).
\STO[High Tolerance to Pollutants thanks to \PRO[Antioxidants\] Mosses filter all of the necessary nutrients from the air and rain but they also accumulate air pollution particles such as heavy metals , \SUB[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\] ( PAHs ) and \SUB[dioxins\]\].
\STO[This ability to actively filter the air has been exploited to monitor the level of air pollution over the years\].
\STO[In order not to poison themselves and to protect from the heavy metals , mosses have a large set of \PRO[antioxidants\] to mitigate the effects of accumulating toxic \SUB[compounds\]\].
\STO[Notably , this high resilience to environmental changes explains why mosses were able to adapt quickly enough to climate changes and survive from the prehistoric times to today\].

\STO[MossCellTec  Acquiring pure moss in a sustainable and reproducible way].
\STO[A Source of Interest that is yet to be Exploited In Traditional Chinese Medicine , more than forty species of bryophytes are used , for example topically , in order to reduce either inflammation or the pain of insect bites\].
\STO[However , until now , mosses did not raise much aware - ness from the cosmetic field mainly because :  they don  t have flowers and are often considered as something to eliminate in gardening they have no relevance as a foodstuff , neither for humans nor animals\].
\STO[Several Drawbacks to Face in order to Access Mosses Mosses are difficult to collect in a sustainable way because :  they grow slowly , are often crucial parts of an eco -system and some species are already suffering from extinction due to the increasing use of land ( such as , for example the approximately 38 % of the more than 1 , 000 moss species in Switzerland\] ( 4 ))
 \STO[they are difficult to identify and therefore harvesting from nature would result in mixed species being collected]
\STO[MossCellTec  Enables the Cell Culture of Mosses in a Sustainable and Reproducible Way MossCellTec  is a novel technology that , for the first time , enables the large scale cultivation of moss cells in sterile conditions and in both a reproducible and sustain - able way\] .
\STO[Indeed , this process requires a small quantity of plant material just once\].
\STO[This technology is based on the capacity of moss cells to divide after the fragmentation of its leaves ( asexual reproduction )\].
\STO[Cells from the \BOT[Physcomitrella patens\] moss were harvested and cultivated in the protonema stage ( germinating spore )\].
\STO[For the first time , a large scale production could be established\].
\MAN[Finally , in order to obtain the MossCellTec  No . 1 cosmetic ingredient , the resulting extract was carefully sprayed on a powder based on \SUB[isomalt\]\].
\STO[Other Advantages of MossCellTec  Technology This technology offers these additional advantages :  availability of plant material regardless of the  mosses may contain toxins and would therefore need season and market demand to be purified  plant material that is completely free of environmental  whilst cultivation in greenhouses is possible , this would pollutants and pesticides .require a lot of land and \SUB[water\]\] .
\RTB[MossCellTec  No . 1 was shown to improve the expression of important cell nucleus health markers involved in the nuclear envelope structure and transport into and out of the nucleus in aged cell\]
\RTB[In vitro and clinical studies showed that MossCellTec  No .1 helps the skin to adapt to fast climatic changes ( cold / hot , low / high relative humidity )\].
\CLA[This results in a significant increase in \BEN[skin hydration\] , homogeneity and \BEN[barrier] function despite changing climatic conditions in just \DUR[two weeks\] , as well as a reduction in \BEN[wrinkle\] depth after just \DUR[four weeks\]\] .
\RTB[Therefore , by maintaining an efficient transport of the molecules into and out of the nucleus and by preserving the organization of the nuclear envelope , the commu - nication inside the cell is optimized and cells can adapt more quickly to the ever - changing environment , making our \BEN[skin more resilient\]\] .
\RTB[Well - organized transport into and out of the cell Resistant and well - structured envelope ( cid : 173 ) fast production of new metabolites ( cid : 173 ) quick adaptation to a changing environment\]
\RTB[Impaired stability of the envelope Reduced transport of proteins and mRNA into and out of the cell nucleus ( cid : 173 ) aging processes ( cid : 173 ) slow adaptation to changes\]
\RTB[Protection of the Cell Nucleus from Aging The ability of MossCellTec  No .1 to protect the structure and activities of the cell nucleus from aging was evaluated by measuring its effect on several genes that were selected for their important role in the nuclear structure and the transport of molecules through the nuclear pores\]
\PRT[Firstly , the expression of these genes was analyzed using quantitative \INS[PCR\] on normal human epidermal \VIT[keratinocytes\] that were isolated from both a young donor ( a \NUM[20\] \UNT[year\] old woman ) and an older donor ( a \NUM[55\] \UNT[year\] old woman )\].
\PRT[Secondly , the \VIT[keratinocytes\] from the older donor were either treated or not ( control ) with different concentrations of the P . patens extract ( for \NUM[24\] \UNT[hours\] )\].
\PRT[From there , the expression of the genes previously defined was analyzed using quantitative \INS[PCR\]\] .
\MOA[Results showed that the expression of the three following genes was decreased in the  older keratinocytes  com - pared to the younger ones :  \MLT[LMNA gene\] that codes for the \MLT[lamin A structural protein\] , a component of the \MLT[lamina TMPO gene\] that codes for the \MLT[LAP2 protein\] , which plays a role in the assembly of the \MLT[nuclear lamina  RANBP17\] gene that codes for the \MLT[Ran - binding protein - 17 ( RanBP17 )\], which is a \MLT[nuclear transport receptor\]\] .
\MOA[However , treatment with \BOT[P . Patens\] extract resulted in an increased expression of these three specific genes in a concentration - dependent manner\] .
\RTB[Therefore , \BOT[P . Patens\] extract exerts a \CLA[rejuvenating\] effect as regards cell nucleus genes and preserves the structure and activities of the cell nucleus despite aging\].
Reinforcement of the Skin Barrier Quality \PRT[The ability of MossCellTec  No . 1 to reinforce the \BEN[skin barrier\] was evaluated by measuring its effect on several genes that were selected for their important role in \BEN[skin barrier\] function , epidermal matrix and \BEN[hydration\]\] .
\PRT[The expression of these genes was analyzed using quantitative \INS[PCR\] on normal human epidermal \VIT[keratinocytes\] that were first either treated or not ( control ) with the \BOT[P . Patens\] extract\] .
\MOA[Results showed that the \BOT[P . patens] extract increased the expression of two important groups of genes :  genes that encode the proteins forming the stratum corneum : \MLT[involucrin\] , \MLT[filaggrin\] , \MLT[repetin\] and \MLT[small proline - rich ( SPRR ) proteins  genes\] that encode the proteins that form junctions between the cells such as \MLT[desmosomes\] ( \MLT[envoplakin\] , \MLT[corneodesmosin\] , \MLT[desmoglein 1\] ) and \MLT[tight junctions\] ( \MLT[F11 receptor\] )\].
\RTB[By stimulating \MLT[filaggrin\] , the \BOT[P . Patens\] extract increases the capacity of the skin to trap and hold water\] .
Furthermore , \RTB[the \BOT[P . Patens\] extract limits water loss by increasing the gene expression of the constituents of the stratum corneum\] .
Last but not least , \RTB[the P . patens extract reinforces the cohesion between the cells by increasing the gene expression of the constituents of \MLT[desmosomes\] and \MLT[tight junctions\]\] .
\RTB[The latter control the diffusion of water and solutes across intercellular spaces and therefore prevents loss of water\] .
