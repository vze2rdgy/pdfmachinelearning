History / Uses
\STO[King of the forest, symbol of wisdom, power and immortality, the oak tree is solid and resists the test of 
time. Sacred tree in numerous traditions, Celts saw in the tree the axis of the world deploying its majesty 
between sky and earth.  

Living  up  to  500  years,  oak  has  to  synthesize  molecules  of  defence  and  protection  to  adapt  to  its 
environment. Indeed, the more vegetal species live on, the more their \PRO[antioxidant\] capital rises. These 
molecules are phenolic compounds mainly \SUB[tannins\], \SUB[ellagitannins\], \SUB[gallotannins\] and condensed \SUB[tannins\], 
which give to oak tree intense \PRO[astringent\] and \PRO[antioxidant\] properties.  

Oak tree is traditional used as an \PRO[astringent\], \PRO[soothing\], \PRO[tonifying\] and \PRO[fortifying\] agent\].
