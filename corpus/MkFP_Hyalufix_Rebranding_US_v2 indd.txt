\TRM[The shadow eraser™\]

\STO[Beauty is mysterious,
we bring out its lighter side
Modifying shadows 
from within
What if radiance was only a matter of 
shadows and light?
Why do the faces of celebrities, when splashed across magazines, beautifully reflect light? Have the 
photos been touched up or is there a scientific reality behind it?

While some faces tend to look dull and lackluster through a lens, others glow with an inexplicable radiance 
as if they have been professionally enhanced.

In fact, there is a physical aspect that makes all the difference in the ability to «catch»  light and glow... 
it is the unique balance of shadows and light that enhance or tarnish our beauty, much more than those 
small crow feets.

What do we call shadows and where do they come from? 
Shadows appear in different areas of our face when we are tired and tend to be accentuated with age. 
These shadowed areas include dark under eye circles, hollowed areas in the cheeks, lines around the 
mouth and shadows under the chin… which are generally caused by weight loss as well as the thinning 
of the skin. 

Is there a molecule in the skin that is capable of restoring volume in order to 
erase shadows and enhance the face’s radiant glow?
There is… the famous \SUB[hyaluronic acid\]! But not just any hyaluronic acid! 
Widely used as a popular injectable filler, as well as a cosmetic ingredient, hyaluronic acid works on 
different levels depending on its form. In fragments, it offers simple moisturizing action. When it has a 
higher molecular weight, it has texturizing and moisturizing properties, yet doesn’t fill in wrinkles because 
it doesn’t penetrate the skin. Certain active ingredients, including hyaluronic acid peptides, help boost the 
production process of hyaluronic acid. However, there is no guarantee that this hyaluronic acid will be of 
high quality…\] 

\DES[Only \SUB[hyaluronic acid\] with high molecular weight has three dimensional \RTB[volume-
enhancing\] properties. This is the type of \SUB[hyaluronic acid\] that we have chosen 
to target with \TRM[Hyalufix™\] GL\].

\MOA[\SUB[Hyaluronic acid\] is produced naturally in the skin by the \MLT[Hyaluronan Synthase family of enzymes\]. One of these 
enzymes is \MLT[HAS-2\], which is the only one that is capable of producing \RTB[\SUB[hyaluronic acid\] with a high molecular 
weight\]. The production of \MLT[HAS-2\] leads to the induction of molecules that enhance volume within the skin\]. 
\CLA[We have discovered that \INC[galanga leaf extract\] has the unique ability to stimulate this \MLT[HAS-2 enzyme\], and in vitro studies 
indicate that the synthesis of \MLT[HAS-2\] results in a quantifiable increase of \SUB[hyaluronic acid\] on the skin\].

\CLA|VIV[A clinical study conducted on \NUM[50\] women showed that \TRM[Hyalufix™\] GL in a \NUM[3\]\UNT[%\] concentration decreases the appearance of \BEN[nasogenian folds\] more effectively than an \BEN[anti-wrinkle\] \SUB[peptide\], after \DUR[4 weeks\] of application. After \DUR[3 months\], we 
noted a visible decrease in the \BEN[appearance of nasogenian folds\]. 

After \DUR[one month\], the panelists themselves found that their faces looked increasingly \BEN[radiant\] and \BEN[voluminous\] (their 
skin had a \BEN[smoother texture and appeared denser, firmer and had shapelier contours\]\]).

\INN[In line with the most recent innovations by Beauty Care Solutions, which have led to products to improve the 
appearance of the face and entire body, \TRM[Hyalufix™\] GL is another innovation to enhance the skin’s appearance 
through \BEN[reducing shadows\], \BEN[improving radiance\], and visibly \BEN[diminishing signs of wrinkles\].
