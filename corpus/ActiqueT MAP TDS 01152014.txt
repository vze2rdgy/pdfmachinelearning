CHARACTERISTICS 

 

• Potent \CLA[anti-oxidant\]; \RTB[protects skin 

from oxidation\] and \CLA[can offer 

protection from UV rays\] 

• \BEN[Anti-aging\]; \RTB[improves skin 

elasticity by enhancing \SUB[collagen\] 

production and strengthening the 

skin’s immune system\] 

• \CLA[Non-irritating skin whitening agent 

that \MOA[inhibits \MLT[tyrosinase\] activity\]\] 

 

      DESCRIPTION 
  

      \DES[Actique™ MAP is a stable \SUB[vitamin C\] derivative that does 

      not readily degrade in formulas containing \INC[water\]. It is 

      \PRO[oxygen-stable\], \PRO[light-stable\], \PRO[non-poisonous\] and \PRO[anti- 

      inflammatory\]\].  

 

      \MOA[By inhibiting \MLT[tyrosinase\] activity, Actique™ MAP is    

      capable of \SUB[melanin\] reduction\]. 

      This makes it effective in \CLA[lightening \BEN[age spots\] and \CLA[whitening 

      dark skin\]. 

 

      In addition, unlike ascorbyl palmitate, \CLA[\TRM[Actique™\] MAP is 

      very compatible with \BEN[sensitive skin\] since it is able to \RTB[boost  

      skin \SUB[collagen\] synthesis\] at a lower concentration\]. 

 

      APPLICATIONS 

 

      \PRD[\TRM[Actique™\] MAP is widely used as a superior grade additive 

      in \LON[lotions\], \LON[creams\], \LON[sun care products\], \LON[after sun care 

      products\], \LON|COS[makeup products\], \BEN[skin-whitening\] products, and 

      \BEN[anti-aging\] products\]. 

 

      \FOR[Formulation Guidelines 
 

      The recommended \USL[volume of usage: \NUM[3~15\]\UNT[%\]\] 

      Best used in products with final \PRO[pH: \NUM[6.0-7.0\]\] 

      \PRT[Stable at \NUM[80\]\UNT[°C\], for up to \DUR[20 hours\], therefore can be added to 

      the water phase prior to heating 

  

      Typical usage rate: 0.2-3, up to 10% 

      Solubility: Soluble in water, mix well, allow time to 

      dissolve\]\] 

      \STR[Shelf life: \DUR[Two years\]\]
