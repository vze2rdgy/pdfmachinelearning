\FIR[MEASURES IN CASE OF FIRE
Suitable extingushing media : Carbon dioxide, stable alcohol resistant foam, powder. Do not use water jet.
Special risks : In case of fire, release of dangerous combustion gases: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide. Gases released
in the event of fire are classed as toxic to the respiratory system.
Special protective equipment : Avoid breathing released fumes or vapours. In case of insufficient ventilation, wear
suitable respiratory equipment.
Cool down the containers with pulverised water from a secure distance\]

\SPL[MEASURES BY ACCIDENTAL SPILLAGE / LEAKAGE
