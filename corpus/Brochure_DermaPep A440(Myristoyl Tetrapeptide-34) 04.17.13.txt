\STO[\SUB[Collagen\] represents the main component of the 
extracellular matrix of the dermal connective tissue and 
its concentration decreases as we age. It is known that 
the loss of collagen, especially in photoaged skin, is not 
only due to a reduction of the synthesis but also due to 
its enhanced degradation. The enzyme mainly 
responsible for \SUB[collagen\] breakdown and inhibition of 
new collagen formation in the skin is MMP-1 which 
cleaves collagen type I, III, VII, VIII. Exposure of the skin 
to UV radiation results in the upregulation of several 
different MMPs and the repeated upregulation of these 
collagen-degrading enzymes over time is thought to 
underlie the collagen damage that is one of the 
hallmarks of photoaging. 
 
In a healthy skin, the synthesis and degradation of the 
matrix are well in balance. However, this intricate 
balance gets disrupted as we age, in which too little of 
the matrix is synthesized and too much is degraded. 
Many of well-known skin aging treatments are aimed at 
replenishing skin matrix by stimulating the synthesis of 
the matrix. Unfortunately, this approach fails in some 
people, especially old people, whose ability to respond 
to matrix synthesis boosters is considerably declined. 
 
\TRM[DermaPepTM\] A440, innovative antiaging tetrapeptide, 
has been developed to maximally and effectively inhibit 
these matrix degrading MMPs and to restore collagen-
levels back to normal. In vitro results show that 
DermaPepTM A440 greatly inhibited the expression and 
production of \MLT[MMP-1\] under both UV-stimulated and 
non-stimulated condition and restored collagen levels 
significantly. In addition, DermaPepTM A440 
considerably lowered the MMP levels that have been 
produced by \MLT[ROS\] or RNS. Finally, in vivo clinical study 
results prove that DermaPepTM A440 is surely one of 
the best antiaging agents in the market\].

assessed by MTT assay and was shown relative to 
untreated control. Absorbance was measured by an

\PRT[Skin irritation test was performed on 31 healthy Asian 
volunteers (Spincontrol Asia (study report number IR-
6Q01-MW-DE08), Bangkok, Thailand)\]. 

Evaluation and grading of skin irritation 
 Erythema (no redness = 0 to very strong redness=5) 
    After 24 hrs, mean score = 0.00 (max = 0) 
    After 48 hrs, mean score = 0.00 (max = 0) 
 Oedema (no oedema = 0 to very strong oedema =5) 
    After 24 hrs, mean score = 0.00 (max = 0) 
    After 48 hrs, mean score = 0.00 (max = 0) 
 Scaling (no scaling = 0 to very strong scaling = 5) 
    After 24 hrs, mean score = 0.00 (max = 0) 
    After 48 hrs, mean score = 0.00 (max = 0) 

Mutagenicity (Ames Test) 

Myristoyl tetrapeptide-34 at 5 different concentrations 
(30,60,90,180, 360 ppm) were evaluated to predict its 
potential to cause mutagenicity. Five different 
auxotrophic mutants were used to assesse directly or in 
the presence of liver S9 fractions. 

No mutagenicity was observed. 

In vitro Ocular Irritation Test 

DermaPep™ A440 at 3 different concentrations (2, 4, 
8 %) and butylene glycol were evaluated with the 
ocular irritection assay system (CA, USA). 

The ocular results demonstrated that the DermaPepTM 
A440 was classified as mild irritants.

Effect on Procollagen 1 Production 

Changes in MMP-1 and ECM gene expression 

Hs68 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and treated 
with retinoic acid or Myristoyl Tetrapeptide-34 
followed by 30J/cm2 UVA. After 48 hours equal 
amounts of cell lysates were subjected to 
electrophoresis and analyzed by western blot for 
procollagen type I. 

Myristoyl Tetrapeptide-34 significantly stimulated the 
production of type I procollagen. 

Hs68 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and treated 
with TGF-, retinoic acid or Myristoyl terapeptide-34 
followed by 30J/cm2 UVA. After 48 hours, total cellular 
RNA was extracted and reverse-transcription PCR was 
performed to determine MMP-1, procollagen 1, 
fibronectin. GAPDH mRNA level was used for sample 
standardization.  

Myristoyl Tetrapeptide-34 significantly inhibited UVA

Comparison with Retinoids

treated with retinyl palmitate, Myristoyl tetrapeptide-
34 or both (left figure) or retinol, Myristoyl 
Tetrapeptide-34 or both(right figure) followed by

Myristoyl Tetrapeptide-34 showed greater effect on 
reducing MMP-1 than retinyl palmitate or retinol alone. 
In addition, there was no synergy between retinyl 
palmitate and Myristoyl Tetrapeptide-34 or retinol and 
Myristoyl Tetrapeptide-34, respectively.

DermaPep™ A440 
In vivo efficacy 

Anti-Aging Efficacy on Asian Skin Type 

In a clinical study with 21 Asian healthy female 
volunteers (Korea), aged 30 to 65, 2 % formula 
containing DermaPep™A440 had been applied twice 
daily during 12 weeks on the face area. Evaluation was 
performed by Transparancy profilometry analysis using 
visiometer SV600(Courage-Khazaka electronic GmbH, 
Germany) and digital photography. 

DermaPep™A440 showed significant improvement in 
all the parameters measured and proved to be the 
powerful anti-wrinkle agent.
