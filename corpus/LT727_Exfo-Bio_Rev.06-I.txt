Mammalian epidermis is a stratified epithelium that retains the ability to self renew under both homeostatic 

and injury conditions by maintaining a population of mitotically active cells in the hair follicles and innermost basal 

layer. The major barrier resides within the exterior layers of the epidermis, which are sloughed off and repopulated 

from these inner cells. The process of terminal differentiation begins when basal cells concomitantly withdraw from 

the cell cycle and lose their ability to adhere to the basement membrane. In the intermediate spinous layers, the 

cells reinforce a durable cytoskeletal framework of keratin filaments to provide the mechanical strength necessary 

to resist physical trauma. 

In  the  granular  layers,  lipids  are  produced  inside  lamellar  bodies,  keratins  are  bundled  into  macrofibrils 

through their association with filaggrin, and a cornified envelope (CE) is assembled by sequential incorporation of 

precursor  proteins  directly  underneath  the  plasma  membrane.  As  the  cell  membrane  disintegrates,  the  CE  is 

assembled by cross-linking several defined structural proteins by both disulfide and γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine isopeptide 

bonds  formed  by  the  action  of  transglutaminases  (TGases).  The  cross-linked  products,  often  of  high  molecular mass, are highly resistant to mechanical challenge and proteolytic degradation, and their accumulation is found in a number of tissues and processes, including skin, hair, blood clotting, and wound healing. 

Recent experimental results  have  demonstrated an essential role for tight  junctions (TJs), located in the 

granular layer, in forming the epidermal barrier. This process of differentiation from a mitotically active basal cell 

to  a  squame,  a  terminally  differentiated  squamous  cell,  is  maintained  throughout  life  as  part  of  epidermal regeneration. In general, the complex mediates cell-to-cell adhesion and communication. In particular, TJs control paracellular  permeability  and  maintain  cell  polarity,  which  are  often  referred  to  as  barrier  and  fence  function, respectively. Like other junction organelles, TJs are composed of transmembrane and intracellular molecules. At the  TJs,  integral  membrane  proteins  are  represented  by  occludin,  junction  adhesion  molecule,  and  claudins. 

Claudins are members of a family that comprises more than twenty proteins with four membrane-spanning regions, 

two extracellular loops, and two cytoplasmic termini. Studies have demonstrated that genetic ablation of claudin-

1 induces neonatal death, which is associated with rapid appearance of wrinkles in the skin and significant body 

dehydration. 

The  process  of  skin  self-renewing  is  particularly  associated  with  claudin-1,  which  promotes  epidermal 

differentiation, and with transglutaminases, which act as a cohesion enhancer mainly in the stratum corneum (Figure 

1). The entire process of human skin replacement takes place in about 3-4 weeks in a young skin. However, over 

time and with the ageing process, cell turnover rates decreases drastically, causing unbalanced tissue repair and 

cell regeneration. 

In this way, the modulation between transglutaminases activity and claudin-1 production plays a crucial role 

in the skin renew and homeostasis, because both increase could lead a skin hardening and rough.

Alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) are a class of chemical compounds that consist of a carboxylic acid substituted 

with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. They may be either naturally occurring or synthetic, and have been 

used for many years in the cosmetics industry. They are often found in products claiming to reduce wrinkles or 

the signs of aging, and improve the overall look and feel of the skin1. They are also used as chemical peels available 

in  a  dermatologist's  office,  beauty  and  health  spas  and  home  kits,  which  usually  contain  a  lower  concentration. 

Although  their  effectiveness  is  documented2  numerous  cosmetic  products  have  appeared  on  the  market  with 

unfounded claims of performance3. Many well-known α-hydroxy acids are useful building blocks in organic synthesis: 

the most common and simple are glycolic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, mandelic acid. AHAs are generally safe when

used on the skin as a cosmetic agent using the recommended dosage. The most common side-effects are mild skin 

irritations, redness and flaking. The severity usually depends on the pH and the concentration of the acid used. 

Chemical peels tend to have more severe side-effects including blistering, burning and skin discoloration, although 

they are usually mild and go away a day or two after treatment. The FDA has also warned consumers that care 

should be taken when using AHAs after an industry-sponsored study found that they can increase photosensitivity 

to the sun.4  

Classical  AHA  can  cause  excess  of  dryness),  redness,  fissuring,  scaling,  and  itching  resulting  in  an 

inflammatory cascade triggered by cytokines released from the epidermis in response to barrier disruption. This 

effects cause discontinuity of treatment.

The  skin  becomes  thicker  until  maturity  and  then  becomes  thinner  in  women  over  50-60  years  old. 

Measurements of skin physical properties show that it becomes thinner, stiffer, less tense and elastic with ageing 

(Diridollou et al., 2001).  

Young's modules (elasticity modules) of the skin, a ratio between stress and deformation, increases linearly 

with age. This is in agreement with data indicating that skin becomes more rigid and less able to stretch in response 

to stress with age. This has to be correlated with the increased crosslinking of collagen, the disorganization of the 

fibril network and the large amount of free water in the dermis. Ageing decreases skin function and causes clinical 

changes such  as wrinkling, color changes (yellowish,  patches,  pigmentation),  and  a loss  of elasticity and  adipose 

tissue (Diridollou et al., 2001). Sagging is one of the major age-related morphological changes in the face. While 

wrinkles and general changes in the face have been well studied, a recent method using photostandards and 3 D 

analysis  of  replicas  shows  that  women's  cheeks  begin  to  sagging  when  they  reach  40  (Tsukahara et al.,  2000). 

Recently  measurements  of  site-related  and  age-dependent  variations  in  facial  skin  show  that  there  is  an  overall 

increase  of  skin  echogenicity  and  thickness  with  age.  The  skin  on  the  upper  and  lower  lips,  on  the  chin  and 

infraorbital  regions  is  thicker  than  that  on  the  central  forehead,  lateral  forehead  and  cheeks.  The  facial  skin 

thickness becomes greater over the lateral regions of the forehead, lips and nose in elderly subjects, and becomes 

thinner over the infraorbital regions (Pellacani e Seidenari, 1999). Fine lines are due to the gradual breakdown of 

collagen and elastin fibers, and they are exacerbated by sun damage. Very deep wrinkles are associated with the 

muscle below the skin surface. Muscles contract more with age to compensate for the loss of volume. Excessive 

exposure to sunlight and smoking can cause major changes in the skin (Lahmann et al., 2001). The skin may darken; 

develop very fine wrinkles, spots, and sag, all of which are symptoms of photoageing. This is a very serious concern 

for  middle-aged  women,  especially  women  in  Asia.  Studies  using  the  two  point  gap  discrimination  method  plus 

microneurographic  recording  in  response  to  mechanical  stimuli  have  also  revealed  changes  in  tactile  spatial 

discrimination in the elderly (Léveque et al., 2000). 

The subcutaneous tissue is also concerned in ageing and it has a crucial role in the skin ageing appearance. 

Menopause,  the  physiological  cessation  of  menstruation  caused  by  decreased  function  of  the  ovaries,  leads  to 

thinning  of  the  dermis,  mainly  due  to  a  decrease  in  the  collagen  content,  atrophy  of  subcutaneous  tissues  and 

increased skin dryness (Broniarczyk-Dyla e  Joss-Wichman, 1999; Bonté, 2001).

Part of this reduced metabolism and function in the adipose tissue is due to a decrease of SREBP-1 (Sterol 

regulatory  element-binding  protein  1),  now  well  established  as  a  key  transcription  factor  for  the  regulation  of 

lipogenic enzyme genes in adipose and other tissues, such as liver. 

During  the  aging,  the  SREBP-1  gene  is  dormant,  and  as  consequence,  the  reduction  of  triglycerides 

accumulation into the adipocyte is also reduced.

\PRT[Cosmetic Appreciability Assessment

This  study  intends  to  check  the  cutaneous  acceptability  and  the  cosmetic  appreciability  of  serum  facial 

antiaging \TRN[Exfo-Bio\] after \DUR[28 days\] (\TPO[D28\]), under normal conditions of use. 

35 female volunteers aged from 35 to 55 years old were selected to this study. 

The cutaneous acceptability was: 

•  Checked every day, by the volunteers themselves at home; 

•  Controlled after visual examination of the experimental area, by a dermatologist or the co-investigator 

or the technician, under his authority, and after questioning of the volunteers. 

The  cosmetic  appreciability  was  verified,  using  a  target  questionnaire  answered  by  the  volunteers  after 

productÊs application\] (Figures 17 to 26).
